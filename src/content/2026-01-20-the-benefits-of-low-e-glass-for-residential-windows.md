# Introduction to Low-E Glass
Low-E glass, or low emissivity glass, is a type of energy-efficient glass designed to reduce heat transfer between the inside and outside of a building. This is achieved through a thin, transparent coating that reflects heat rather than absorbing it.
## How Low-E Glass Works
* Reduces heat gain in the summer by reflecting solar radiation
* Minimizes heat loss in the winter by reflecting internal heat back into the building
* Can be used in a variety of applications, including double-pane and triple-pane windows
## Benefits of Low-E Glass
* **Energy Efficiency**: Low-E glass can help reduce energy consumption by minimizing the need for heating and cooling.
* **UV Protection**: The coating on low-E glass can block up to 99% of ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can cause fading and discoloration of furniture and carpets.
* **Reduced Condensation**: By reducing the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the glass, low-E glass can help minimize condensation and fogging.
## Conclusion
Low-E glass is a valuable investment for homeowners looking to improve the energy efficiency and comfort of their homes. With its ability to reduce heat transfer, block UV radiation, and minimize condensation, low-E glass is an excellent choice for residential windows.
