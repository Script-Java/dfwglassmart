### Introduction to Low-E Glass
Low-E glass, or low emissivity glass, is a type of energy-efficient glass designed to reduce heat transfer between the inside and outside of a building. This advanced glass coating minimizes the amount of ultraviolet and infrared light that enters or leaves a room, resulting in significant energy savings.

### How Low-E Glass Works
* The low-E coating is applied to one side of the glass pane.
   * This coating reflects radiant heat rather than absorbing it, keeping warm air in during the winter and out during the summer.
   * By reducing heat gain in the summer and heat loss in the winter, low-E glass helps maintain a consistent indoor temperature, reducing the need for air conditioning and heating.

### Benefits of Low-E Glass
* **Energy Efficiency**: Low-E glass can reduce energy consumption by up to 30% compared to traditional glass.
   * **UV Protection**: The low-E coating blocks 99% of UV rays, reducing fading of furniture, carpets, and drapes.
   * **Reduced Condensation**: By minimizing temperature differences between the inside and outside of the glass, low-E glass reduces condensation and the risk of mold and mildew.

### Conclusion
Low-E glass is an excellent choice for homeowners looking to reduce their energy consumption, minimize UV damage, and maintain a comfortable indoor climate. At DFW Glass Mart, our experienced team can help you choose the perfect low-E glass solution for your residential needs.
