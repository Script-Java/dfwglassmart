## 1. **Boost Your Home’s Appearance Instantly**

Garage doors take up major visual space. Adding glass inserts:

* Breaks up dull metal with texture and style.
* Complements modern, farmhouse, or classic homes.
* Makes your home stand out from the street.

> **Design Tip:** Frosted or tinted glass offers privacy while still improving curb appeal.

## 2. **Let Natural Light into Your Garage**

Most garages are dark and underused. Glass windows:

* Brighten the space with natural daylight.
* Improve visibility for storage or workspace areas.
* Reduce the need for artificial lighting.

> **Lighting Insight:** Natural light transforms your garage from storage to usable living space.
