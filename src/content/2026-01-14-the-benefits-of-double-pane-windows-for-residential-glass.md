# Introduction to Double-Pane Windows
Double-pane windows, also known as insulated glass units (IGUs), consist of two panes of glass separated by a gap. This gap is usually filled with air or a gas like argon, which acts as an insulator. At DFW Glass Mart, we highly recommend double-pane windows for residential properties due to their numerous benefits.
## Energy Efficiency
* Double-pane windows reduce heat transfer between the inside and outside of your home, keeping your home warmer in winter and cooler in summer.
* This results in lower energy bills and a reduced carbon footprint.
## Noise Reduction
* The gap between the two panes of glass acts as a sound barrier, reducing external noise pollution.
* This is particularly beneficial for homes located near busy roads or airports.
## UV Protection
* Double-pane windows can block up to 99% of UV rays, protecting your furniture and carpets from fading.
* This also reduces the risk of skin damage and skin cancer.
## Security and Durability
* Double-pane windows are more difficult to break than single-pane windows, providing an added layer of security for your home.
* They are also less prone to damage from extreme weather conditions.
# Conclusion
If you're looking to upgrade your residential glass, consider installing double-pane windows. With their energy efficiency, noise reduction, UV protection, and security benefits, they are a worthwhile investment for any homeowner. Contact DFW Glass Mart today to discuss your options.
