# Introduction to Windshield Safety 
Windshield safety is a critical aspect of vehicular maintenance, often overlooked until it's too late. A cracked or damaged windshield can pose significant risks to drivers and passengers. In this article, we'll delve into the importance of windshield safety, prevention measures, and repair options. 
## Why Windshield Safety Matters 
* **Visibility**: A clear windshield ensures unobstructed visibility, reducing the risk of accidents caused by impaired vision. 
* **Structural Integrity**: The windshield is a crucial component of a vehicle's structural integrity, providing protection in the event of a rollover or collision. 
* **Injury Prevention**: A damaged windshield can shatter upon impact, causing severe injuries to occupants. 
## Prevention Measures 
To minimize the risk of windshield damage, consider the following: 
* **Regular Inspections**: Schedule regular inspections to identify potential issues before they become major problems. 
* **Avoid Extreme Temperatures**: Sudden changes in temperature can cause the glass to expand or contract, leading to cracks or shattering.
